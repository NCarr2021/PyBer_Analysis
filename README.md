# PyBer_Analysis

# Module 5 Challenge 

# Overview of Analysis:

The purpose of the analysis is to provide PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, 
several visualizations that show data comparisons using the large amount of ride-share 
data. The visual charts will show relationship of city type, number of riders and number
of drivers as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by city type.
The results will be used to help improve ride-sharing access and affordability in low
service areas. 

# Results:

Ride and City data were combined to summarize the data by City Type, the Fares, Rides and Drivers and to determine
averages in Fare per Ride and per Driver. The Total Fare by City Type plot chart represents data for a specific time 
frame (January 1, 2019 through April 29, 2019) and shows that the Urban City Type has the largest Total Rides and 
Total Fares as compared to Rural or Suburban city types. The Rural city type has the lowest of fares and drivers.

Differences in ride-sharing data: 

![PyBer_Summary_DF](/analysis/PyBer_Summary_DF.png)

- Ridership for all City Types show volumes peak during late to end of February.

- Rural Fares peaked the first week in April possibly due regionally held local events

- Urban has a lower Fare per Ride due to shorter distances traveled and more frequent trips.
The higher population adds to the higher number of drivers and rides

- Suburban has a fair number of drivers however the Average Fare Per Ride is in between Urban and 
Rural because distances aren't as short as Urban or as long as Rural.  

- Suburban ridership spiked at the end of April  possibly due to local event (sports, festivals, etc).

- Rural is a larger geographic area which covers longer distances than Urban or Suburban 
attributing to higher fares per ride and fewer drivers. Fewer riders pay per ride and likely
have their own transportation.

# Summary:

Three recommendations to CEO for addressing any disparities among thge city types:

- Due to large geographic area, Rural City Type doesn't reflect large growth potential.
If Rural areas will be targeted to increase ridership, further analysis may be required to 
obtain additional info for targeting local events since fares spiked early April.

- Urban city types have larger populations congested into smaller areas and more growth potential. 
Further analysis at the city level may be required to identify areas with little or no coverage.

- Suburban city types has potential for growth. The spike in ridership mid-January, the end of March and
end of April may reflect local events. Suggest further analysis to identify specific cities and the key events
to advertise ride-sharing.
